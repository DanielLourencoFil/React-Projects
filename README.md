## REACT projects page

"All big things are made of small things"
This is a principle that has guided me on all I've made and built in my life.
It is true to whatever human action, from crafts to relationships...

On this page, I'm registering my progress in my learning journey in REACT.
It contains small projects that I coded in order to master the main concepts of React. Most of the projects
are inspired by the exercises of courses I took. The final result contains my solution to the exercises, and also my own CSS and HTML.
